 * PF2e GM Core / Core Rulebook Table 10-9 Treasure by Level (Total Value
 * column), ORC-licensed reference data — see README attribution section,
 * same as the other benchmark tables in this file.
 *
 * The published table covers CHARACTER levels 1-20 only (this is a
 * party-progression table, not a creature table): it is the total treasure a
 * party should accumulate across a whole level of play. The -1/0 and 21-24
 * rows are OUR extrapolation so the table indexes like every other table in
 * this file: level 0 ≈ half of level 1, level -1 ≈ half of level 0; levels
 * 21-24 continue the late-game compounding curve at ~1.45x per level
 * (consistent with the 17-19 trend). These edge rows are a reasoned
 * assumption, not published data.
 *
 * Transcription-confidence note: levels 1-12 were recalled with high
 * confidence; the exact digits for 13-20 are less certain (the order of
 * magnitude and shape are right). One shape anomaly worth flagging rather
 * than silently "fixing": the 19→20 step (355,000 → 490,000, ×1.38) breaks
 * the accelerating ×1.55/×1.63/×1.71 run just before it. That may well be
 * how the book prints it (level 20 is the campaign's final level), but if a
 * high-level game feels off, this row is the one to re-check against the
 * book.
 *
 * Re-checked (issue #50 item 8): a second independent recall pass reproduced
 * every row unchanged, including the 19→20 anomaly above verbatim — no digit
 * corrections came out of it. This is NOT the same as a primary-source
 * verification, though: every external fetch tool available this session
 * (WebFetch, and direct requests to Archives of Nethys/pf2easy/pf2calc/even
 * plain sites like Wikipedia) returned 403 — a session-wide network
 * restriction, not this table being unreachable specifically — so this could
 * only be cross-checked against itself, not the book. Confidence is
 * unchanged from before; if it matters for a real game, a 30-second manual
 * check against GM Core/Player Core (or Archives of Nethys, ID=2656) from a
 * normal browser is still the only way to actually close this out. */
