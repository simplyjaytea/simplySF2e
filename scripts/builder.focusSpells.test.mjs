// Regression check for the NPC focus-spell clamp (feat/npc-focus-spells):
// normalizeConcept coerces raw `focusSpells` into [{name}] records, drops
// falsy/empty/junk entries BEFORE applying the 3-entry cap (the hard PF2e
// focus-pool ceiling), so the first 3 VALID names survive — same as the PC
// clamp (pc-builder.focusSpells.test.mjs) — PLUS the NPC-only scope gate:
// when `spellcasting` is absent/invalid, focusSpells is forced to [] no
// matter what the AI sent (focus-only creatures are out of scope in v1;
// focus spells ride on the normal spellcasting DC).
// Run: node scripts/builder.focusSpells.test.mjs
//
// normalizeConcept is pure enough to real-import: its only Foundry touch is
// a `typeof CONFIG !== "undefined"` guarded trait filter, so like the PC
// focus-spell test this imports the REAL function rather than porting it.
