SCALE = "extreme"|"high"|"moderate"|"low". SCALE5 also allows "terrible".

Design guidance (GM Core road maps):
- At most ONE extreme stat, balanced by a low or terrible stat.
- Brute: low perception; moderate+ AC; high Fort, low Ref/Will; high HP; high attack & damage.
- Sneak: high dex; low Fort, high Ref; high stealth; moderate HP.
- Skirmisher: high Ref, fast speeds, moderate everything else.
- Soldier: high AC, high Fort, high attack with moderate damage; disciplined soldiers/guards/knights should usually get the Attack of Opportunity glossary reaction.
- Spellcaster: casting tradition matching key ability at high or extreme; low-or-moderate AC, HP and attack; DC one scale above attacks.
- Include spellcasting only when it truly fits the concept and the user allows it.
- "focusSpells": fit priests/cultists (a domain spell), ki-using martial casters, druid/shaman-like creatures, witch-like hexers — only when the concept has spellcasting AND genuinely fits one of these archetypes; leave [] otherwise. Uncommon, not the default.
- Use standard glossary abilities (Grab, Push, Knockdown, Trample, Swallow Whole, Frightful Presence, Regeneration, Attack of Opportunity, ...) wherever they fit. They are selected from the compendium afterward and retain their real working automation.
- A bespoke signature ability is allowed only as a short, clearly narrative description (a scent, texture, visual aura, or mannerism). Do not give it rules text or mechanical effects; the module will label it narrative-only rather than create custom mechanics.
- Traits, languages, senses and speeds must follow PF2e conventions.`;

  "equipment": [ { "name": string, "quantity": number, "value": number } ] // 4-8 first-draft carried items with EXACT PF2e item names (${REMASTER_NOTE}) fitting the class, level and concept — include STARTING ARMOR appropriate to the class's armor proficiency (e.g. plate/chain for heavy-armor martials, leather/studded for light-armor types), a weapon, useful mundane gear, AND at least 1-2 level-appropriate magic items (a potion or elixir; for a spellcaster, a spell scroll of a real PF2e spell in their tradition they'd want as backup) when the character's level plausibly affords them; lightly-armored casters may deliberately carry no armor. When the level affords it, write the main weapon and armor with their fundamental runes in the name ("+1 striking longsword", "+1 resilient half plate" — roughly +1 potency from level 2, striking/resilient from level 4, +2 potency from level 10). Also include skill-supporting gear matching the character's likely trained skills — Thieves' Tools for Thievery, a Climbing Kit or Grappling Hook for Athletics, Healer's Tools for Medicine, a Disguise Kit for Deception, an Alchemist's Tools kit for Crafting, and general utility items (a Spacious Pouch, a Sturdy Shield). Inspiration only, the final picks are chosen from the compendium in a second step
}

Design guidance:
- Pick an ancestry, background and class that together tell a coherent, thematic character matching the GM's concept.
- Default to common ancestries (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Leshy) unless the concept specifically calls for something exotic — use rare or uncommon ancestries sparingly, only when they genuinely fit.
- "keyAbility" MUST be a legal key ability for the class you chose (e.g. Fighter is str or dex, Wizard is int, Cleric is wis).
- Only include "spellcasting" for classes that actually cast spells (Wizard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Bard, Witch, Oracle, Magus, Summoner, ...) and only when spellcasting is allowed.
- "focusSpells": Champion (e.g. Lay on Hands), Cleric (a domain spell, e.g. Fire Ray), Druid (an order spell, e.g. Tempest Surge), Sorcerer (a bloodline spell), Wizard (a curriculum spell), Monk (a ki spell), and Bard/Oracle/Witch/Psychic commonly have them — name 1-3 that plausibly fit this build; leave [] if the class/concept doesn't have any.
- Give the character real personality texture, not just combat stats: mannerisms, likes/dislikes, and at least one named ally, enemy, or organization tying them into a wider world — a blank or generic answer for these is a worse answer than a specific, concept-fitting one.
- feats/spells/equipment are first drafts only — write plausible real names; a later grounding step selects the actual final picks from the real compendium.`;

Design guidance:
- The "effects" array is for ALWAYS-ON passives only. A once-per-day or triggered ability goes in the OPTIONAL "activation" field instead (the player clicks a generated macro to use it, once per day).
- An item may have passive effects AND an activation, or just one, or (rarely) neither. Give the item at least ONE of the two unless the concept is purely a flavor trinket. Prefer a passive for "always" wording ("you can see in the dark", "resist fire"); prefer an activation for "once per day / when you / you can spend an action to" wording ("unleash a blast", "heal a wound", "frighten a foe", "gain a burst of speed").
- Match power to level and rarity: one modest effect for low-level items, two or three (or one strong one) only for high-level or rare items.
- The item should feel like it belongs in a published book: grounded flavor, a clear identity, one memorable image.`;
