/**
 * GM Core Table 10-10 "Character Wealth" (Chapter 1: Running the Game >
 * Rewards > Treasure > "Treasure for New Characters", GM Core pg. 61) — the
 * wealth a PC who is *created at* the given level starts with. Indexed by
 * level 1-20 via PC_WEALTH_BY_LEVEL[level - 1].
 *
 * VERIFIED against Archives of Nethys (Remaster GM Core), fetched from
 *   https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2662
 * The table there has three columns — "Permanent Items", "Currency", and
 * "Lump Sum". The column transcribed below is the LUMP SUM column, verbatim:
 *
 *   lvl 1  15 gp        lvl 11   3,200 gp
 *   lvl 2  30 gp        lvl 12   4,500 gp
 *   lvl 3  75 gp        lvl 13   6,400 gp
 *   lvl 4  140 gp       lvl 14   9,300 gp
 *   lvl 5  270 gp       lvl 15  13,500 gp
 *   lvl 6  450 gp       lvl 16  20,000 gp
 *   lvl 7  720 gp       lvl 17  30,000 gp
 *   lvl 8  1,100 gp     lvl 18  45,000 gp
 *   lvl 9  1,600 gp     lvl 19  69,000 gp
 *   lvl 10 2,300 gp     lvl 20 112,000 gp
 *
 * WHY THE LUMP SUM COLUMN: the "Permanent Items" + "Currency" pair is the
 * default allotment — a GM hands the player specific items of listed levels
 * PLUS a little coin. The Lump Sum column is the book's own explicitly
 * sanctioned alternative ("you can allow the player to instead start with a
 * lump sum of currency and buy whatever common items they want, with a
 * maximum item level of 1 lower than the character's level"), and it is
 * exactly what this module does: it buys gear separately out of one pool
 * rather than granting a prescribed item ladder. Its level-1 entry, 15 gp,
 * matches the flat 15 gp every 1st-level character gets at character
 * creation, so level 1 needs no special case any more.
 *
 * The table's PERMANENT-ITEMS component is intentionally NOT modeled. The
 * lump sum is deliberately worth less than items+currency (the book says so),
 * which is the correct trade for a module that lets the buyer pick freely.
 * Modelling the recommended per-level item ladder is part of the separate
 * known equipment gap — HANDOFF.md finding #15.
