// Regression check for the PC focus-spell clamp (feat/pc-focus-spells):
// normalizePCConcept coerces raw `focusSpells` into [{name}] records, drops
// falsy/empty/junk entries BEFORE applying the 3-entry cap (the hard PF2e
// focus-pool ceiling — see pc-builder.mjs normalizePCConcept), so the first
// 3 VALID names survive, and never yields undefined/null for the field.
// Run: node scripts/pc-builder.focusSpells.test.mjs
//
// normalizePCConcept is pure (no foundry.*/game.* globals — those only appear
// in createCharacterActor and the resolve helpers), so like the wealth test
// this imports the REAL function rather than porting the logic.
